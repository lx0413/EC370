# Great Recession 2007–2009
to prop up financial markets and stimulate the economy: 

--

- the Federal Reserve System (central bank of the U.S): easing monetary policy 
  - federal funds rate (i.e. benchmark interest rate) $\downarrow$
  - liquidity provision (i.e. cash) $\uparrow$ 
  
--
  
- Other government regulatory agencies:

## Why Study Money and Banking
Money, banking and financial systems are important to economic well-being:
- **Financial markets** (bond market, stock market...) play an important role in financial system   
  - so that we can buy and sell financial instruments quickly and cheaply
- **Financial intermediaries** (banks, insurance companies...) play a crucial role in the economy
  - collecting information about prospective borrowers to ensure they are creditworthy
- **Money** and **monetary policy** affect economic variables such as business cycle, inflation, interest rates
  - central banks using monetary policy to monitor and stabilize the economy
--->



---
# Financial Markets
- **Financial market**: the market in which funds are transferred from people who have an excess of available funds to people who have a shortage

--

- Examples: New York Stock Exchange, Chicago Board of Trade for commodities

--
  
- Roles: channels funds from people who do not have a productive use for them to those who do
  


---
# Financial Instruments
- **Financial instrument** (also called **security**): a claim on the issuer's future income or asset 
  - sold by borrower (issuer) to lender (holder)
  - debt security: bond
  - equity security: stock 
  
  
---
# Financial Instruments
## Bond 
- **Bond**: a security that promises to make periodic payments for a specified period of time
 
--

- Examples: 
  - Corporate Bonds 
  - U.S. Government Securities, State and Local Government Bonds
  
--
  
- Role: 
  - enables corporations and governments to borrow to finance their activities 
  - determines **interest rates**
  


---
# Financial Instruments
## Interest Rate (chpt 4, 5, 6)
- **Interest rate**: the cost of borrowing 
  
--

- Examples:
  - interest rates on many different types of bonds 
  - mortgage interest rates, car loan rates 

--

- Changes in interest rates affect individuals, financial institutions, businesses, and the overall economy
  - interest rate $\uparrow$: C $\downarrow$, S $\uparrow$; I $\downarrow$
  - interest rate $\downarrow$: C $\uparrow$, S $\downarrow$; I $\uparrow$

<small><small>
C: consumer consumption; S: consumer saving; I: firm investment 
</small></small>




---
# Financial Instruments
<img src="../ch1/chpt1_Image/different_interest.png" width=600>
- Different interest rates have a tendency to move in unison
  - economists frequently lump interest rates together and refer to “the” interest rate

- Different interest rates can differ substantially

---
# Financial Instruments
## Stock 
- **commom stock** (typically called simply **stock**): a security that claims on the earnings and assets of the corporation
  - With more shares of common stock issued and outstanding, the previous stockholders' percentage of ownership decreases
  - Issuing stock and selling it to the public is a way for corporations to raise funds to finance their activities
  
- Changes in stock prices affect individuals, financial institutions, businesses, and the overall economy
  - Stock prices $\uparrow$: W $\uparrow$, C $\uparrow$, I $\uparrow$
    
<br />   
<small><small>
W: consumer wealth
</small></small>

# Financial Instruments
## Debt vs. Equity
- Equity holders is **residual claimant**: corporation must pay all its debt holders before it pays its equity holders 

- Equity holders benefit directly from any increases in the corporation’s profitability or asset value: equities confer ownership rights on equity holders

- Size of the debt market is often substantially larger than the size of the equities market: debt is generally less risky: interest and principal are paid at specified dates 


---
# Financial intermediaries (chpt 2, 9)
- **Financial intermediaries**: institutions that borrow funds from people who have saved and in turn make loans to people who need funds


- Examples:
  - **banks**: accept deposits and make loans
  - insurance companies


- Because banks are the largest financial intermediaries in our economy, they deserve the most careful study in this course






<!---
#### Financial crises 
- **financial crises**: major disruptions in financial markets that are characterized by sharp decline in asset prices and the failures of many financial and nonfinancial firms


- Examples: U.S. Great Recession
  + Defaults in subprime residential mortgages led to major losses in financial institutions, notably Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, two of the largest investment banks in the U.S
--->



---
# Money (chpt 3)
- **Money** is also referred to as **money supply**


- **Money**: anything that is generally accepted in payment for goods or services or in the repayment of debts


<img src="../ch1/chpt1_Image/money.png" width=700>


<!---
#### Money and Business Cycle (chpt 19)
- Money plays an important role in generating **business cycles** 
  + **business cycle**: the upward and downward movement of aggregate output in economy
    + **expansion**, peak, **recession**, and trough
<img src="../chpt1_Image/business_cycle.png" width=500>
--->



<!---
#### Money and Business Cycle (chpt 19)
- Rate of money growth has declined before almost every recession
  + changes in money might be a driving force behind business cycle fluctuations
- Declines in the rate of money growth are often not followed by a recession
<img src="../chpt1_Image/money_business.png" width=600>
--->



---
# Money and Inflation (chpt 19)
- Price level and the money supply generally rise together
  - a continuing increase in the money supply might be an important factor in causing inflation

<img src="../ch1/chpt1_Image/inflation.png" width=600>



<!---
#### Money and Interest Rate (chpt 5)
- Money plays an important role in interest-rate fluctuations
- Does an increase in the rate of money supply growth lower or raise interest rates?
  - 1960s-1970s: when the rate of money supply growth climbed, interest rates rose
  - 1980s-1990s: when money supply growth declined, interest rates declined 
<img src="../ch1/chpt1_Image/money_supply_interest_rate.png" width=600>
--->




---
# Monetary Policy (chpt 14-15)
- Because money can correlate with many macroeconomic variables, politicians and policymakers care about the conduct of **monetary policy**


- **Monetary policy**: the management of **money supply** and **interest rates**


- The organization responsible for the conduct of a nation’s monetary policy is the **central bank**
  - In the U.S., monetary policies are conducted by the **Federal Reserve System** (also called **the Fed**)



<!---
#### Fiscal Policy (chpt 19)
- The government must finance any **budget deficit** by borrowing, whereas a **budget surplus** leads to a lower government debt burden
  - **budget deficit**: an excess of government expenditures with respect to tax revenues for a year
  - **budget surplus**: arises when tax revenues exceed government expenditures


- **Fiscal policy**: decisions about **government spending** and **taxation**
--->




<!---
#### Fiscal Policy  (chpt 19)
- The government must finance any **budget deficit** by borrowing, whereas a **budget surplus** leads to a lower government debt burden
- Budget deficits might lead to a higher rate of money growth, a higher rate of inflation, and higher interest rates

# Aggregate Output 
- **Gross domestic product (GDP)** is the most commonly reported measure of **aggregate output**


- GDP: the market value of all final goods and services produced in a country during the course of a year

  - market price of cars in 2015 \* quantity of cars produced + market price of corn flakes in 2015 \* quantity of corn flakes produced + ...



---
# Real Versus Nominal Magnitudes
- Growth in GDP: 
  - from the growth in the quantity of output: beneficial
  - from the growth in prices: not so good
  
--

- Separating changes in the quantities from changes in the prices requires sepearing **real GDP** from **nominal GDP**
  - nominal GDP: calculated using current prices
  - real GDP: calculated using prices for an arbitrary base year, say 2009
  - real GDP in 2015 = 2009 price of cars \* quantity of cars produced in 2015 + 2009 price of corn flakes \* quantity of corn flakes produced in 2015 + ...


---
# Aggregate Price Level
- Aggregate price level: average prices in the economy

--

- GDP deflator: nominal GDP divided by real GDP
  - GDP deflator equaling 1.11 indicates that, on average, prices have risen 11% since base year
  
--

- Consumer price index (CPI): pricing a “basket” of goods and services bought by a typical urban household




---
# Growth Rates and Inflation Rate
- Growth rate: the percentage change in a variable

--

- Growth rate of x = $\frac{x_t - x_{t-1}}{x_{t-1}} \times 100\%$

--

- Inflation rate: the growth rate of the aggregate price level

---
# Participation #1

Here comes our first participation exercise. 

- I have posted the document "Ch1_participation" on Canvas, which contains exercises we are going to practice 

- You can either print this document and write down your answers in the blank space, or write down your answers on a piece of paper

  

---
# Participation #1
* Q1: If real GDP grew from $9 trillion in 2019 to $9.5 trillion in 2020, then the GDP growth rate for 2020 would be?

--

- Answer: $\frac{9.5-9}{9} \times 100\% =5.6\%$
  
--

* Q2: If the cost of the basket rises from $500 to $600, CPI has risen by? 

--

- Answer: $\frac{600-500}{500}=0.2=20\%$
  
--

- Q3: If the GDP deflator rose from 111 in 2019 to 113 in 2020, the inflation rate using the GDP deflator would be?

--

- Answer: inflation rate = $\frac{113-111}{111} \times 100\% = 1.8\%$


---
# Practice Problems
- Note that it is your responsibility to write legibly, take a high quality scan of your responses, compile all pages into one pdf, and upload only one pdf document to Canvas by **11:59pm, PDT, Sunday, April 5** to earn 1 point for Participation #1

--

- Practice problems and keys will be posted on Canvas after we finish each chapter. It is designed for you to practice questions similar to what may appear on an exam that requires algebraic, graphical and written solutions. You don't need to submit it.

--

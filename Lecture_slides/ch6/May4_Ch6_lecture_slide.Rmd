# Yield Curve

- **Yield curve**: a plot of the yields on bonds with **differing** terms to maturity but the **same** risk, liquidity, and tax considerations

--

- Yield curves have three basic shapes
  - **upward-sloping** (most common): long-term interest rates > short-term interest rates
  - **flat**: short- and long-term interest rates are the same
  - **downward-sloping or inverted**: long-term interest rates < short-term interest rates


---
# Yield Curve

Upward-sloping yield curve: 

- **long-term interest rates is larger than short-term interest rates**

# Yield Curve

A good theory of the yield curve must explain these following **three important empirical facts**:

- **Fact #1**: interest rates on bonds of different maturities move together over time

- **Fact #2**: When short-term interest rates are low, yield curves are more likely to have an upward slope; when short-term interest rates are high, yield curves are more likely to slope downward

- **Fact #3**: Yield curves almost always slope upward


  



---
# Yield Curve

Three theories of the yield curve: 

- Expectations theory: can only explain Fact #1 & #2

- Segmented markets theory: can only explain Fact #3

- Liquidity premium theory: 
  - combination of expectations theory and segmented markets theory
  - can explain Fact #1 & #2 & #3

# (1) Expectations Theory

For an investment of $1, there are two investment strategies for the choice of holding for 2 periods:

--

**Option 1**: purchase a 1-yr bond, and when it matures in 1 year, purchase another 1-yr bond

--

**Option 2**: purchase a 2-yr bond and hold it until maturity

--

- interest rate on a 1-yr bond at time t: $i_t$
- interest rate on a 1-yr bond _expected_ for time t + 1: $i^e_{t+1}$
- interest rate on the 2-yr bond at time t: $i_{2t}$


<!---
draw a time line: from t to t+1, i_t; from t+1 to t+2: i^e_{t+1};
draw another time line: from t to t+2: i_{2t}
--->




---
# (1) Expectations Theory

- expected return for Strategy 1:
$$(1+i_{t})(1+i^e_{t+1})-1=i_{t}+i^e_{t+1}+i_t(i^e_{t+1})\approx i_{t}+i^e_{t+1}$$

--

- expected return for Strategy 2:
$$(1+i_{2t})(1+i_{2t})-1=2i_{2t}+(i_{2t})^2 \approx 2i_{2t}$$

--

- **Key assumption of Expectations Theory**: bonds with different maturities are perfect substitutes
  - the expected returns on bonds with different maturities are equal



---
# (1) Expectations Theory

- equalize: $$2i_{2t}=i_{t}+i^e_{t+1}$$

--

- rewrite: $$i_{2t}=\frac{i_t+i^e_{t+1}}{2}$$

--

- generalize: interest rate on an n-yr bond is

  - $$i_{nt} = \frac{i_t+i^e_{t+1}+i^e_{t+2}+\dots+i^e_{t+(n-1)}}{n}$$

<!---the n-yr interest rate equals the average of the one-yr interest rates expected to occur over the n-yr life of the bond--->

---
# Participation 7

- Q1 (1): the current interest rate on the one-year bond is 5%. If the 1-yr interest rates over the next four years are **expected** to be 6%, 7%, 8%, and 9%. Find out the interest rate on a 2-yr bond, a 3-yr bond, a 4-yr bond, and a 5-yr bond. Also draw the yield curve. 

--

$$i_{nt} = \frac{i_t+i^e_{t+1}+i^e_{t+2}+\dots+i^e_{t+(n-1)}}{n}$$





---
# Participation 7

(1) Given $i_t=5\%$, $i_{t+1}^e=6\%$, $i_{t+2}^e=7\%$, $i_{t+3}^e=8\%$, $i_{t+4}^e=9\%$: 
- $i_{2t}=\frac{5\%+6\%}{2}=5.5\%$
- $i_{3t}=\frac{5\%+6\%+7\%}{3}=6\%$
- $i_{4t}=\frac{5\%+6\%+7\%+8\%}{4}=6.5\%$
- $i_{5t}=\frac{5\%+6\%+7\%+8\%+9\%}{5}=7\%$

# (1) Expectations Theory
$$i_{nt} = \frac{i_t+i^e_{t+1}+i^e_{t+2}+\dots+i^e_{t+(n-1)}}{n}$$

- upward-sloping yield curve: the long-term rate is currently higher than the short-term rate

- this can occur only if short-term interest rates are **expected** to rise, on average, in the future
  


- downward-sloping yield curve: 
  - the long-term rate is currently lower than the short-term rate
  - implying that short-term interest rates are **expected** to fall, on average, in the future 


- flat yield curve: 
  - the long-term rate is currently same as the short-term rate
  - short-term interest rates are not **expected** to change, on average, in the future

# Participation 7

- Q1 (2): if $i_t$ increases from 5% to 6%. Assume people expect interest rate on a 1-yr bond at time $t+1$ increases from 6% to 7%, and interest rate on a 1-yr bond at time $t+2$ increases from 7% to 8%, but do no adjust expectations further.

--

- Find out the interest rate on a 2-yr bond, a 3-yr bond, a 4-yr bond, a 5-yr bond, and draw the yield curve

(2) Given $i_t=6\%$, $i_{t+1}^e=7\%$, $i_{t+2}^e=8\%$, $i_{t+3}^e=8\%$, $i_{t+4}^e=9\%$:

- $i_{2t}=\frac{6\%+7\%}{2}=6.5\%$
- $i_{3t}=\frac{6\%+7\%+8\%}{3}=7\%$
- $i_{4t}=\frac{6\%+7\%+8\%+8\%}{4}=7.25\%$
- $i_{5t}=\frac{6\%+7\%+8\%+8\%+9\%}{5}=7.6\%$

# (1) Expectations Theory

- In summary, **A rise in actual short-term rates raises peopleâ€™s expectation on future short-term rates**. Therefore, increasing actual and expected short-term rates jointly drives up longer-term rates

--

- This is exactly why we observe **Fact #1** : interest rates on bonds of different maturities move together over time
  - $i_t \uparrow \Rightarrow i_{2t} \uparrow,...,i_{nt} \uparrow$
  - $i_t \downarrow \Rightarrow i_{2t} \downarrow,...,i_{nt} \downarrow$

--

- How does Expectations Theory explains **Fact #2**?


---
# Participation 7

Post the 2007-2009 Great Recession, interest rate on 1-yr T-bills is usually less than 2%. So the current 5% 1-yr interest rate is way too high. Therefore, people expect the rates to decline in the future. 

--

- Q1 (3): Assume people expect interest rate on a 1-yr bond at time $t+1$ decreases from 6% to 4%, and interest rate on a 1-yr bond at time $t+2$ increases from 7% to 3%, and interest rate on a 1-yr bond at time $t+3$ and $t+4$ are back to 2%. 

--

- Find out the interest rate on a 2-yr bond, a 3-yr bond, a 4-yr bond, a 5-yr bond, and draw the yield curve 


---
# Participation 7

(3) Given $i_t=5\%$, $i_{t+1}^e=4\%$, $i_{t+2}^e=3\%$, $i_{t+3}^e=2\%$, $i_{t+4}^e=2\%$: 
- $i_{2t}=\frac{5\%+4\%}{2}=4.5\%$
- $i_{3t}=\frac{5\%+4\%+3\%}{3}=4\%$
- $i_{4t}=\frac{5\%+4\%+3\%+2\%}{4}=3.5\%$
- $i_{5t}=\frac{5\%+4\%+3\%+2\%+2\%}{5}=3.2\%$

--

<img src="chpt6_Image/yield3.png" width=400>

- This exactly why we observe **Fact #2**: yield curves tend to be inverted when short-term rates are high (vice versa)





  
---
# (2) Segmented Markets Theory

- Expectations Theory assumes that investors do not prefer bonds of one maturity over another 

<!---bonds with different maturities are perfect subsititutes--->

--

- However, people may prefer short-term bonds to long-term bonds
  - people who are limited by a short holding period will prefer to hold short-term bonds

<!---
- risk-averse investors generally prefer bonds with shorter maturities that have less interest-rate risk
--->
  
--

- And people may prefer long-term bonds to short-term bonds
  - someone who was putting funds away for their young child to go to college would want to hold longer-term bonds

--

- So when expectations theory does not hold and fails to explain Fact #3, we need another theory

<!---
Expectations Theory fails to explain why short-term interest rates are **usually** expected to rise (**Fact#3**) because its assumption might not hold. 
--->




---
# (2) Segmented Markets Theory

- **Key assumption of segmented markets theory**: bonds of different maturities are NOT substitutes

<!---just like fruits and cars are not subsitutes--->

--

- demand/supply for different maturity bonds are independent and completely separated 

<!---demand/supply of fruits is segmented from demand/supply of cars--->

--

- interest rates of bonds of different maturity are determined by the demand and supply of that bond only are independent 

--

- Recall Chapter 4: shorter-term bonds have less interest rate risk, and shorter-term bonds are typically more liquid

--

- Therefore, investors typically prefer shorter-term bonds
  

---
# (2) Segmented Markets Theory

Hence, **demand** for long-term bonds is **typically** lower than that for short-term bonds

<img src="chpt6_Image/segment.png" width=600>

--

- In summary: under segemented markets theory, **long-term bonds typically have higher interest rates** (this is exactly Fact #3)




---
# (3) Liquidity Premium Theory

- Let's call the additional interest that investors require as compensation for buying longer-term bonds: **liquidity premium**

--

- $l_{nt}$: liquidity premium for the $n$-year bond at time t
  - $l_{nt}>0$, for all $n$ 
  - $l_{nt}$ grows with the term to maturity $n$ (longer-term bonds have greater liquidity premium)

--

$$i_{nt} = \frac{i_t+i^e_{t+1}+i^e_{t+2}+\dots+i^e_{t+(n-1)}}{n}+l_{nt}$$

<!---
The interest rate on a long-term bond will equal an average of short-term interest rates expected to occur over the life of the long-term bond plus a liquidity premium that responds to supply and demand conditions for that bond 
--->


---
# (3) Liquidity Premium Theory

$$i_{nt} = \frac{i_t+i^e_{t+1}+i^e_{t+2}+\dots+i^e_{t+(n-1)}}{n}+l_{nt}$$

- As a combination of expectation theory and segmented markets theory, liquidity premium theory assumes bonds of different maturity are partial (not perfect) substitutes

--

- Fact #1 and #2 are explained by the first term in the equation 

--

- Fact #3 is explained by the second term in the equation - the liquidity premium term



---
# Participation 7

- Let's return to the exercise

- Q1 (4): the current 1-yr interest rate is 5%, and 1-yr interest rates over the next four years are expected to be 6%, 7%, 8%, and 9%. Assume liquidity premiums for 2- to 5-yr bonds are 0.25%, 0.5%, 0.75%, and 1.0%, respectively.

- Find out the interest rate on a 2-yr bond, a 3-yr bond, a 4-yr bond, a 5-yr bond, and draw the yield curve 

$$i_{nt} = \frac{i_t+i^e_{t+1}+i^e_{t+2}+\dots+i^e_{t+(n-1)}}{n}+l_{nt}$$


---
# Participation 7

(4) In part (1), we have solved the first term for each bond to be: $5\%, 5.5\%, 6\%, 6.5\%, 7\%$. Given $l_{t}=0\%$, $l_{2t}=0.25\%$, $l_{3t}=0.5\%$, $l_{4t}=0.75\%$, $l_{5t}=1\%$: 
- $i_{t}=5\%+0\%=5\%$
- $i_{2t}=5.5\%+0.25\%=5.75\%$
- $i_{3t}=6\%+0.5\%=6.5\%$
- $i_{4t}=6.5\%+0.75\%=7.25\%$
- $i_{5t}=7\%+1\%=8\%$

# Interpreting Yield Curve

- Recall Chapter 5: falling interest rates are associated with recessions (procyclical)

--

- when inverted yield curve is observed, short-term interest rates are expected to fall sharply in the future, and the economy is expected to be more likely to enter a recession

--

- Yield curve is a powerful predictor of an economic downturn 


---
# Interpreting Yield Curve

<img src="chpt6_Image/evidence.png" width=350>

The steep inverted yield curve occurred on January 15, 1981 
- This indicated that short-term interest rates were expected to decline sharply in the future
- Indeed, by March 1981, 3-month Treasury bill rates had declined from the 16% to 13%
- Soon afterwards, a recession started in July 1981 



---
# Interpreting Yield Curve

**Who discovered the predictive power of the yield curve?**

- The relationship between inverted yield curve and recessions was
discovered by Professor Campbell Harvey in his dissertation in 1986. He got his Ph.D. from University of Chicago

--

**What measure to choose?**

- Common measures are 2-year/10-year spread and 3-month/10-year spread
  - available from 1976-: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y2Y
  - available from 1982-: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y3M


<!---
# Interpreting Yield Curve

**Why does this indicator work?**

- when the Fed cut federal funds rates in their July 30-31 meeting, the short-term bond rates came down immediately

- However, with concerns over a global slowdown and uncertainties from the U.S.-China trade war, people shift assets into the U.S. long-term Treasury bond, the safest asset in the world 

- Buying pressure on the long-term bonds drives prices up, thereby lowering long-term yields

- leading to an inverted yield curve on Aug 14, plummeting the stock market for its worst day of 2019 
--->


---
# Interpreting Yield Curve

**If the yield curve flattens, when will it invert? If the yield curve inverts, when will the recession happen?**

- Indeterminate ... The lags can be 12 months, 18 or 20 months. But the recession will not happen right away.

--

- Professor Harvey said the curve needs to stay inverted for three months to be reliable

--

- Although the yield curve has a strong track record, it is not a cause of a financial crisis, nor does it share any insight onto the timing and magnitude of a recession (there can be false positives)






<!---
The 2-year/10-year preceded five recessions, and the 3-month/10-year preceded all seven of the past recessions with two false positives (an inversion in late 1966 and a very flat curve in late 1998
--->




<!---
# Interpreting Yield Curve

**Are there other indicators that we should watch to help us forecast a recession?**

- the Duke-CFO survey, which has been going on for 25 years, has an excellent track record. CFOs know the capital spending and employment plans before the plans are executed. Two-thirds of the U.S. CFOs believe a recession will begin in 2020. 

- Jeremy Piger at UO: a dynamic-factor Markov-switching (DFMS) model that calculate monthly recession probabilities (https://pages.uoregon.edu/jpiger/us_recession_probs.htm/)

# Interpreting Yield Curve

<img src="chpt6_Image/up.png" width=600>

**Steeply rising yield curve**: short-term interest rates are expected to rise in the future

**Moderately steep yield curve**: short-term interest rates are not expected to rise or fall much in the future

<!---
- when short-term interest rates are expected to rise in the future $\Rightarrow$
- their average plus the liquidity premium will be higher than the current short-term rate $\Rightarrow$
- long-term interest rates are higher than short-term interest rates $\Rightarrow$
--->

<!---
- when short-term interest rates are not expected to rise or fall much in the future $\Rightarrow$
- average remains the same as the current short-term rate, and the positive liquidity premium for longer-term bonds explains the moderate upward slope of the yield curve  $\Rightarrow$
--->

---
# Interpreting Yield Curve

<img src="chpt6_Image/down.png" width=600>

**Flat yield curve**: short-term interest rates are expected fall moderately in the future

**Inverted yield curve**: short-term interest rates are expected to fall sharply in the future


<!---
- when short-term rates are expected to fall moderately in the future $\Rightarrow$
- it offsets the positive value of liquidity premium  $\Rightarrow$
--->


---
# Interpreting Yield Curve

**What does yield curve say about inflation?**

- Recall Chapter 4 Fisher Equation: $i=r+\pi^e$
  - when observing flat or inverted yield curve: short-term $i$ are expected to fall 
  - hence inflation is expected to decline in the near future

<!---
The yield curve of 1m T-bill shows how much it costs the federal government to borrow money; reveal the relationship between long- and short-term interest rate

short-term rate nearly zero: the Fed

long-term rate low: strong foreign demand 

Yields in Germany are negative: Investors who buy a German 7-year bond now, and hold onto it until 2022, are essentially agreeing to lose money. They will be paid back less money than they lent the government.
Yields in Japan have been low for decades, as the country struggled with deflation

With rates so low in Europe and Japan, the rates in the United States are actually among the highest in the highly industrialized world.
The bond market expects slow growth and very low inflation for years to come.

<!---
2019 FOMC Meeting:
- January 29-30: No fed funds rates cut
  - The Fed was satisfied with current rates of economic growth, inflation, and unemployment
- March 19-20: No rates cut
  - The Fed didn't think growth and inflation were strong enough to warrant another increase
- April 30 - May 1: No rates cut
  - The Fed said employment and economic growth was strong, although inflation was a little below its 2% target.
- June 18-19: No rates cut
  - The Fed said it may cut the rate in July if global growth slows and inflation remains below the Fed's target. 
  
- July 30-31: because business spending is soft, and inflation is slightly below the 2% target, the FOMC lowered the short-term federal funds rate for the first time in the year 

- Aug 1: the 2-year bond rates came down and widened slightly against the 10-year bond rates, extending the spread 

- Concerns over a global slowdown, and uncertainties from the U.S.-China trade war, have weighed heavily on longer-term U.S. Treasury yields
  
- Aug 14, 2019: yield curve inverted, plummeting the stock market for its worst day of 2019 

- Spet 17-18: The FOMC lowered the rate to by 0.25%.

- October 29-30 meeting: ? 

- stocks fell since analysts predicted three more cuts in 2019

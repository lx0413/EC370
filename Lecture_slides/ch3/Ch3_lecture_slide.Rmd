# Meaning of Money

**Money**: anything that is generally accepted as payment for goods or services or in the repayment of debts

--

- Money is also called **money supply**

--

- Example: 
  - currency: dollar bills and coins
  - checking/saving account deposit...
  
--

- Are bonds, common stock, art, land, furniture, cars, houses... money? 



<!---
# Meaning of Money
- **money** vs. **wealth** 
  - wealth: all resources owned by an individual, including all assets
- wealth includes:    
  - money
  - bonds, common stock, art, land, furniture, cars, houses...
- **money** vs. **income** 
  - income: flow of earnings per unit of time (**flow** concept) 
  - money: amount measured at a given point in time (**stock** concept)
--->

  
<!---
- Anything that is used as a means of payment must be a store of value and thus is very likely to become a unit of account
- The function as a **medium of exchange** is what distinguishes money from other assets such as stocks, bonds, and houses  
--->


---
# Functions of Money
## (1) Medium of Exchange (Means of Payment)
- barter economy: goods and services are exchanged directly for other goods and services
  - double coincidence of wants
  
--
  
- money being used as a **medium of exchange** promotes economic efficiency
  - minimizes transaction cost: the time spent trying to exchange goods or services
  - allows people to specialize in what they do best 
  


---
# Functions of Money
## (2) Unit of Account
in barter economy: if there are N goods in economy, need $\frac{N(N-1)}{2}$ prices to exchange one good for another: $(N-1)+(N-2)+...+1=\frac{N(N-1)}{2}$


--
  
- if money is used as **unit of account**: 
  - quoting the price of goods in terms of dollar
  - if there are N goods in economy, only need N prices 
  - minimizes transaction cost and promotes economic efficiency



---
# Functions of Money
## (3) Store of Value
- a **store of value** is used to save purchasing power from the time income is received until the time it is spent

--

- Other asset can also be used as store of value
  - pros: a higher interest rate (bonds), price appreciation (art), a roof over head (house)...
  - cons: high transaction costs when converting into money (not liquid)

--

- Money can be used as store of value: 
  - pros: money is the **most liquid** asset, because it is the **medium of exchange**



---
- How good a store of value money is depends on price level

--

- when price level doubles, value (purchasing power) of money drop by half; when price level drops by half, value of money doubles 

--

- money **loses** value rapidly during times of **inflation** or **hyperinflation** (an extreme inflation in which the inflation rate exceeds 50% per month)

--
  
- Example: Germany, post World War II, inflation rate was 1,000% per month
  - no one wants to hold on to money
  - the use of money to carry out transaction fell, while barter exchange increased






---
# Evolution of Payments System
payments system: the method of conducting transactions in the economy

--

## (1) Commodity Money
- money made up of precious metals or another valuable commodity: gold, silver, cigar (prisoner-of-war camp during WWII)
  
--

- pros: 
  - universally accepted 
  - could be made into standardized quantities
  - durable
- cons: heavy to carry 

  


---
# Evolution of Payments System
## (2) Fiat Money

<!---
In the past, paper currency was backed by the precious metal
- paper currency was redeemable on demand for metal like gold or silver
- if high quantities of the currencies are issued while the metal wasn't enough, currencies become worthless
--->

**Fiat money**: paper currency backed by government decree as **legal tender**

- legal tender MUST be accepted as legal payment for debts

<img src="../ch3/chpt3_Image/dollar.png" width=500> 

<!---
- not convertible into precious metal
--->

<!---
Cecchetti textbook: historic stories (U.S civil war), golden standard abandon, can change fiat money as Euro in 2002 
--->

- Fiat money can be accepted as legal payment for debts only if: there is some trust in the authorities who issue it. Policymakers must be credibly committed to limiting the volume in circulation
  
  
<!---
- printing has reached a sufficiently advanced stage that counterfeiting is difficult
--->



---
# Evolution of Payments System
## (2) Fiat Money
- pros: light
- cons: expensive to transport in large amounts  

<img src="../ch3/chpt3_Image/fiat.png" width=600> 





---
# Evolution of Payments System
## (3) Checks
An instruction to bank to transfer money from your account to someone else’s account 
- pros: makes transactions for large amounts easier because they can be written for any amount up to the balance in the account
- cons: paper shuffling and clearing process involves issuer’s bank, receiver’s bank, and the Fed, which takes days 

- Is check is legal tender? 




---
# Evolution of Payments System
## (4) Electronic Payment and E-money

Electronic funds transfers are movements of funds directly from one account to another

--

- estimated cost savings when a bill is paid electronically rather than by a check exceed one dollar per transaction

--

- examples: 
  - pay utility bill online
  - debit card
  - stored-value card: UO ID card, Walmart gift card, prepaid phone card (it doesn’t bear your name)
  - e-cash: Paypal

--

- Credit card is not money. It represents access to someone else’s money

# M1 and M2 Money Supply


<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px></html>



---
# Measuring Money: M1
- The Fed has settled on the following measures of the **money**(**money supply**), which are also referred to as **monetary aggregates**

--

- M1: the **narrowest** measure, including only the **most liquid** assets

--

- M1 = <br>
**currency** <br>
\+ **traveler’s checks**  <br>
\+ **demand deposits**  <br>
\+ **other checkable deposits**




---
# Measuring Money: M2
- The M2 adds to M1 other assets that are **not quite as liquid as** those included in M1

--

- M2 = **M1** <br>
  \+ **Small-denomination time deposits** <br>
  \+ **Savings deposits** <br>
  \+ **Money market mutual fund shares** <br>
  \+ **money market deposit accounts** <br>


---
# Measuring Money
## M1 and M2

- Growth rates of M1 and M2 tend to move together
- Growth rates of M1 and M2 can move in different directions in short run 
- the choice of monetary aggregate as the best measure of money supply is important for policymakers

<!---
<img src="../ch3/chpt3_Image/liquidity.png" width=300> 
FUN FACTS: Who are holding these much currency
- More than $4,500 of U.S. **currency** (paper money and coins) are held per person in the United States
  - criminals, drug dealers, gansters (less traceable), some cash businesses (tax evasion), foreigners (hedge against high inflation risk)  
--->


<!---
- if M1 $\uparrow$: M2 $\uparrow$
- if M2 $\uparrow$: M1 does not necessarily inincrease
- transfer within M1: M1 unchanged
- transfer between M1 and M2: M1 changed, M2 unchanged

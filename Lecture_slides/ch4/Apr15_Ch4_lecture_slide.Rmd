# Participation 4

- Q1: At $t$ (today), you spend 1,000 to buy a 10%-coupon-rate coupon bond that has face value of 1,000. The current interest rate is 10%. At $t+1$ (one year from today), you sell the bond after holding for 1 year. Suppose at $t+1$, the interest rate rises to 20%. Complete this table. 

```{r table-0, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
options(knitr.kable.NA = '')
    
dt <- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 5, nrow = 3))
  
colnames(dt)<-c("Price of bonds today($)", "Current yield", "Price of bond next year($)", "Rate of capital gain", "Rate of return")

row.names(dt)<-c("5 years to maturity when bond is purchased", "3 years to maturity when bond is purchased", "1 year to maturity when bond is purchased")

dt[,1] <- c(1000, 1000, 1000)

dt %>%

- Current yield: $i_c=\frac{C}{P_t}=\frac{c \times F}{P_t}=\frac{10\% \times 1000}{1000}=10\%$

--

- Price next year: $P_{t+1}=\frac{100}{1+0.2}+\frac{100}{(1+0.2)^2}+\frac{100}{(1+0.2)^3}+\frac{100}{(1+0.2)^4}+\frac{1,000}{(1+0.2)^4}=741$

(1) The only bonds whose returns will equal their initial yields to maturity are those whose times to maturity are the same as their holding periods



---
# Holding Period Returns

```{r table-5, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
dt <- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 6, nrow = 6))
colnames(dt)<-c("Years to maturity when bond is purchased","Initial Current yield", "Initial price($)","Price of bond next year($)", "Rate of capital gain", "Rate of return")

dt %>%
  mutate_at(c("Years to maturity when bond is purchased", "Rate of capital gain"), function(x) {
    cell_spec(x, bold = T,
              color = spec_color(x, end = 0.9)#,font_size = spec_font_size(x)
              )
  }) %>%
  kable(escape = F, align = "c") %>%
  kable_styling(c("striped", "condensed"), full_width = F)
```


(2) A **rise** in interest rates is associated with a fall in bond prices, resulting in capital losses on bonds whose terms to maturity are longer than their holding periods




---
# Holding Period Returns

```{r table-6, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
dt <- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 6, nrow = 6))
colnames(dt)<-c("Years to maturity when bond is purchased","Initial Current yield", "Initial price($)","Price of bond next year($)", "Rate of capital gain", "Rate of return")

dt %>%
  mutate_at(c("Years to maturity when bond is purchased","Initial price($)", "Price of bond next year($)"), function(x) {
    cell_spec(x, bold = T,
              color = spec_color(x, end = 0.9)#,font_size = spec_font_size(x)
              )
  }) %>%
  kable(escape = F, align = "c") %>%
  kable_styling(c("striped", "condensed"), full_width = F)
```

(3) The more distant a bond’s maturity date, the greater the size of the percentage price change associated with an interest rate change




---
# Holding Period Returns

```{r table-7, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
dt <- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 6, nrow = 6))
colnames(dt)<-c("Years to maturity when bond is purchased","Initial Current yield", "Initial price($)","Price of bond next year($)", "Rate of capital gain", "Rate of return")

dt %>%
  mutate_at(c("Years to maturity when bond is purchased", "Rate of return"), function(x) {
    cell_spec(x, bold = T,
              color = spec_color(x, end = 0.9)#,font_size = spec_font_size(x)
              )
  }) %>%
  kable(escape = F, align = "c") %>%
  kable_styling(c("striped", "condensed"), full_width = F) 
```

(4) The more distant a bond’s maturity date, the lower the rate of return that occurs as a result of an increase in the interest rate

# Holding Period Returns

```{r table-8, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
dt <- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 6, nrow = 6))

dt[,6]<-c(-.397, -.384, -.303, -.159, .017, .1)

dt %>%
  mutate_at(c("Initial Current yield", "Rate of return"), function(x) {
    cell_spec(x, bold = T,
              color = spec_color(x, end = 0.9)#,font_size = spec_font_size(x)
              )
  }) %>%
  kable(escape = F, align = "c") %>%
  kable_styling(c("striped", "condensed"), full_width = F) 
```

(5) Even though a bond may have a substantial initial yield to maturity, its return can turn out to be negative if interest rates rise

# Interest-Rate Risk

- After you have purchased a bond, if there is goin to be a rise in interst rate, then it means that the price of the bond you are holding will fall and experience a capital loss; if the loss is large enough, the bond you are holding can be a poor investment

--

- **Changes in interest rates** lead to capital gains or losses

--

- **Interest-rate risk**: the possible reduction in returns associated with changes in interest rates
  - because we never know with certainty what interest rate will be in the future

 
---
# Interest-Rate Risk

- There is **NO interest-rate risk** for any bond whose time to maturity is equal to the holding period 
  - the price at the end of the holding period is already fixed at the face value
  
--

- Bonds whose terms to maturity are longer than their holding periods are subject to interest-rate risk
  

  
---
# Interest-Rate Risk
  
- When interest rate **increases**, bonds with a more distant time to maturity suffer a greater **decrease** in price, implying a greater capital **loss** and may be **negative** holding period return

--

- Prices and returns for long-term bonds are more volatile than those for shorter-term bonds. 

--

- Long-term bonds have substantial interest-rate risk, compared to short-term bonds

--

- **Changes in interest rates** make investments in **long-term** bonds quite **risky**

# Inflation risk
## Bonds are risky! 
- Risk: uncertainty in determining assets’ return

--

- We have discussed **Interest-rate risk** 

--

- In addition to interest rate risk, bonds have:
  - default risk (will discuss this in Chapter 6)
  - **inflation risk**
  
<!---
- default risk: The issuer may not make the promised payments on time
- We are uncertain whether the bond issuers can pay off coupon and principal
- We usually ignore default risk in thinking about U.S. Treasury bonds
- Default risks cannot be ignored for bonds issued by many other governments or by private corporations
--->

  
<!---
- Inflation Risk: Inflation may turn out to be higher than expected, reducing the real return on holding the bond
- we are uncertain whether our money turn out to be worthless
--->

---
# Inflation risk

* At the beginning of 2018, you lend $100 over one year with an interest rate of 5%. By the end of 2018, you receive $105. If inflation over the year is 5%, do you think that you really earn $105?

--

- The answer is NO. Because of inflation, the real value of your money is $100 (105/1.05)
  - At the beginning of 2018, bagel price is 1 dollar. $100 could buy 100 bagels
  - Over the year, the inflation rate is 5%, which means that the price of all goods and services increase by 5%. Hence, bagel now costs 1*1.05 = 1.05
  - At the end of 2018, $105 can only buy 100 bagels
  - With an inflation of 5%, $100 at the beginnig of 2018 has the same purchasing power as $105 at the end of 2018
 


---
# Inflation risk

- If you knew that inflation would be 5% over the year, then you would have required an interest rate greater than 5%

--

- No one cares only about the number of dollars. People also care about what those dollars can buy. In other words, everyone cares about **real interest rates** 

--

- **Nominal interest rate**: interest rate that does not take inflation into account (the ones that appear in the newspaper and on bank statements)

--

- **Real interest rate**: is adjusted for changes in the price level, i.e. inflation (it reflects more accurately the true cost of borrowing or benefits of lending)

# Distinction Between Real and Nominal Interest Rates


<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px></html>


---
# Fisher Equation: $r=i-\pi^{e}$

- nominal interest rate $i$: observable 

--

- $\pi^{e}$: expected inflation
  - Twice a year the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia publishes professional forecasts
  - Once a month, the Survey Research Center of the University of Michigan computes consumer inflation expectations
  
--

- real interest rate $r$: unobservable, but can be estimated by Fisher equation 

--

- Fisher Equation: $r=i-\pi^{e}$



---
# Fisher Equation: $r=i-\pi^{e}$

- When the real interest rate is low, is there greater incentives to borrow or to lend?

--

- Answer: To borrow!

--

* If you expect the inflation rate to be 15% next year and a one-year bond has a yield to maturity of 7%, what is the real interest rate on this bond?  

--

- Answer: $r=i-\pi^{e} = 7\%-15\% =-8\%$

---
# Fisher Equation: $r=i-\pi^{e}$

<img src="../ch4/chpt4_Image/real_interest.png" width=500>

- blue line: nominal interest rate
- red line: estimated real interest rate 
- expected inflation: gap between two lines
- when red line goes above blue line, expected inflation is negative



---
# Fisher Equation: $r=i-\pi^{e}$

<img src="../ch4/chpt4_Image/real_interest1.png" width=500>

- real and nominal interest rate usually move together but do not always do so (recall Fisher Equation)


  
  
---
# Fisher Equation: $r=i-\pi^{e}$

<img src="../ch4/chpt4_Image/real_interest2.png" width=500>

How much was NOMINAL interest rate between 2009 to 2015?
- Roughly nominal interest rate reached a lower limit of zero
- https://ycharts.com/indicators/3_month_t_bill



---
# Fisher Equation: $r=i-\pi^{e}$

<img src="../ch4/chpt4_Image/real_interest2.png" width=500>

- Historically were there any period that NOMINAL interest rate became negative? 
- negative nominal interest rate: Switzerland (1970), Sweden (2009-10), Denmark (2012), EU (2014), Japan (2016)

  
  
<!---  
- Nominal interest rate has a zero lower bound
  - Policymakers deliberately set interest rate above zero so they have room to conduct expansionary monetary policies (lower interest rate)
  - When nominal interest rate is negative, people who save (lenders) would see their savings account decrease bit by bit. They would rather withdraw their deposits and hold cash instead
--->


---
# Fisher Equation: $r=i-\pi^{e}$

<img src="../ch4/chpt4_Image/real_interest3.png" width=600>

- Can REAL interest rate be negative? (recall Fisher Equation: when expected inflation exceed nominal interest rate)

---
- This is the end of Chapter 4. Practice problems and answer key have been posted to Canvas, which will help you work on Problem Set #2. 

- Problem Set #2 is due **11:59 (PDT), Sunday April 19**. No late submission will be accepted. Compile all pages into one pdf document and submit **one and only one legible pdf document**. Points will be deducted if submissions do not follow the instructions.

- Participation #2, #3, and #4 are due 11:59 (PDT), Sunday June 7. However, an extra credit assignment has been created for early submissions. If you submit Participation #2, #3, and #4 by **11:59 (PDT), Sunday April 19**, you will get 1 extra credit. 

- An announcement will be made on Canvas soon about logistics of this exam and how to prepare for this exam. 

<!---
- Until recently, real interest rates in the United States were not observable; only nominal rates were reported

- This all changed when, in January 1997, the U.S. Treasury began to issue **indexed bonds**, whose interest and principal payments are adjusted for changes in the price level

- the interest rate on these bonds provides a direct measure of a real interest rate

- subtracting their interest rate from a nominal interest rate on a nonindexed bond generates more insight into expected inflation

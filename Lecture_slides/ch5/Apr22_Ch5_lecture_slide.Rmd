# Demand Curve for Bond

- demand curve: relationship between quantity demanded and price
- x-axis: quantity demanded of bond
- y-axis: price of bond (**P**), also interest rate of bond (**i**)

--

Letâ€™s consider purchasing a discount bonds
- no coupon payments
- face value (F): $1,000
- years to maturity: 1 year 
- holding period: 1 year


---
# Demand Curve for Bond

- What is interest rate (yield to maturity), if bond price is $950?

--
  - $P=\frac{F}{1+i}$
  - $i=\frac{F-P}{P}=\frac{1000-950}{950}=5.3\%$

--

- What is interest rate, if bond price is $850?

--
  - $i=\frac{F-P}{P}=\frac{1000-850}{850}=17.6\%$
  
--

- What is interest rate, if bond price is $750?

--
  - $i=\frac{F-P}{P}=\frac{1000-750}{750}=33.0\%$

# Demand Curve for Bond

- **negatively** related: if P $\uparrow$, then $B^d$ $\downarrow$

---
# Supply Curve for Bond

- At lower P (higher i), quantity supplied of bonds is lower

<img src="../ch5/chpt5_Image/supply_bond.png" width=400>





---
# Equilibrium 

- $B^d=B^s$: **bond market equilibirum**

--
  - equilibrium quantity: $300 billion
  - equilibrium price (P*): $850
  - equilibrium interest rate (i*): 17.6%
  
<img src="../ch5/chpt5_Image/eq_bond.png" width=400>
  


---
# Equilibrium 

- $B^d>B^s$: **excess demand**

--
  - P will rise until reaching P\*, i will fall until reaching i\*
  - move along supply curve from F to C, move along demand curve from E to C 
  
<img src="../ch5/chpt5_Image/excess_demand_bond.png" width=400>



---
# Equilibrium 

- $B^d<B^s$: **excess supply**

--
  - P will fall until reaching P\*, i will rise until reaching i\*
  - move along supply curve from I to C; move along demand curve from A to C 
  
<img src="../ch5/chpt5_Image/excess_supply_bond.png" width=400>



---
# Equilibrium 

- The relationship between quantity demanded and quantity supplied of bonds determines interest rate 

--
- **move along** the demand/supply curve until reaching the **equilibirum interest rate**

<img src="../ch5/chpt5_Image/moving_bond.png" width=400>
 



<!---
* Recall Ec202: 
- **Ceteris paribus**: the assumption that all **other** economic variables are held **constant**
* So far, when we study how quantity demanded/supplied of bonds determines the change of interest rate
  + we have assumed all **other** economic variables that can affect interest rate are held **constant**
  + then, we **move along** demand/supply curve so that interest rate can change to its equilibrium level
- **Other** economic variables that can affect interest rate:
  + bond buyer's wealth
  
  
  + expected profitability of the corporate that issues the bond......
* What if these economic variables are **NOT constant**? 
* If one of those other economic variables that affect interest rate are **NOT** held constant, how will equilibrium interest rate change?

# Changes in Equilibrium Interest Rates

- Now, we will look at **shift** of supply/demand curves

--

- And how **shift** of supply/demand curves determines equilibrium bonds' prices and **equilibirum interest rate**



---
# Demand Curve Shift

Changes in factors that affect how many bonds people will want to hold will make **demand curve for bonds shift**
 
 
- Wealth
- Expected returns on bonds relative to alternative assets
  - Expected interest rate
  - Expected return on alternative assets
  - Expected inflation
- Risk of bonds relative to alternative assets
- Liquidity of bonds relative to alternative assets



---
# Demand Curve Shift
## (1) Wealth

- if wealth increases, demand for bonds at each bond price (or at each interest rate) rises
  - business cycle expansion
  - increased propensity to save



---
# Demand Curve Shift
## (1) Wealth

- **business cycle expansion (or: propensity to save increases)** $\Rightarrow$ wealth increases $\Rightarrow$ demand for bonds increases $\Rightarrow$ demand curve shifts to the right

--

<img src="../ch5/chpt5_Image/demand_right.png" width=300>


---
# Demand Curve Shift
## (1) Wealth

- if wealth decreases, demand for bonds at each bond price (or at each interest rate) decreases
  - business cycle recession
  - decreased propensity to save
  


---
# Demand Curve Shift
## (1) Wealth

- **business cycle recession (or: propensity to save decreases)** $\Rightarrow$ wealth decreases $\Rightarrow$ demand for bonds decreases $\Rightarrow$ demand curve shifts to the left

--

<img src="../ch5/chpt5_Image/demand_left.png" width=300>




---
# Demand Curve Shift
## (2) Expected returns 

- Recall Chapter 4: if interest rate when you sell the bond is higher than the interest rate when you buy the bond $\Rightarrow$ the price at which you sell the bond is lower than the price at which you buy the bond 

--

- interest-rate risk: interest rate rises $\Rightarrow$ bond price falls $\Rightarrow$ capital loss $\Rightarrow$ rate of return falls


--

- if you expect that interest rate will rise in the future, then you also expect that return on bonds will fall; hence, you demand less bonds today 



---
# Demand Curve Shift
## (2) Expected returns 

- **expected future interest rates** increases $\Rightarrow$ expected return on bonds decreases $\Rightarrow$ demand for bonds decreases $\Rightarrow$ demand curve shifts to the left

--

<img src="../ch5/chpt5_Image/demand_left.png" width=300>

- **expected future interest rates** decreases $\Rightarrow$ demand curve shifts to the right


---
# Demand Curve Shift
## (2) Expected returns 

- **expected return on alternative assets** increases $\Rightarrow$ expected returns on bonds relative to alternative assets decreases $\Rightarrow$ demand for bonds decreases $\Rightarrow$ demand curve shifts to the left

--

<img src="../ch5/chpt5_Image/demand_left.png" width=300>

- **expected return on alternative assets** decreases $\Rightarrow$ demand curve shifts to the right


---
# Demand Curve Shift
## (2) Expected returns 

- Recall Chapter 4: $r=i-\pi^e$

--

- **expected inflation** increases $\Rightarrow$ real interest rate decreases $\Rightarrow$ expected return on bonds decreases $\Rightarrow$ demand for bonds decreases $\Rightarrow$ demand curve shifts to the left



---
# Demand Curve Shift
## (2) Expected returns 

<img src="../ch5/chpt5_Image/demand_left.png" width=250>

- **expected inflation** decreases $\Rightarrow$ demand curve shifts to right

---
# Demand Curve Shift
## (3) Risk 

- prices in the bond market become more volatile $\Rightarrow$ **riskiness of bonds** increases $\Rightarrow$ demand for bonds decreases $\Rightarrow$ demand curve shifts to the left

--

<img src="../ch5/chpt5_Image/demand_left.png" width=300>



---
# Demand Curve Shift
## (3) Risk 

- an increase in the volatility of prices in another asset market (e.g. stock market)  $\Rightarrow$ **riskiness of alternative assets** increases $\Rightarrow$ demand for bonds increases $\Rightarrow$ demand curve shifts to the right

--

<img src="../ch5/chpt5_Image/demand_right.png" width=300>


---
# Demand Curve Shift
## (4) Liquidity

- more people started trading in the bond market $\Rightarrow$ easier to sell bonds quickly $\Rightarrow$ **liquidity of bonds** increases $\Rightarrow$ demand for bonds increases $\Rightarrow$ demand curve shifts to the right

--

<img src="../ch5/chpt5_Image/demand_right.png" width=300>



---
# Demand Curve Shift
## (4) Liquidity

- **liquidity of alternative assets** increases $\Rightarrow$ demand for bonds decreased $\Rightarrow$ demand curve shifts to the left
  - the reduction of brokerage commissions for trading common stocks in 1975

--

<img src="../ch5/chpt5_Image/demand_left.png" width=300>




---
# Supply Curve Shifts

Changes in factors that affect how many bonds corporates or government will want to issue will make **supply curve shift**
 
--
 
- Expected profitability of investment opportunities
- Expected inflation
- Government budget deficits




---
# Supply Curve Shifts
## (1) Expected Profitability of Investment Opportunities

- business cycle expansion $\Rightarrow$ **expected profitability of investment opportunities** increases $\Rightarrow$ supply of bonds increases $\Rightarrow$ supply curve shifts to the right

--

<img src="../ch5/chpt5_Image/supply_right.png" width=300>


---
# Supply Curve Shifts
## (1) Expected Profitability of Investment Opportunities

- business cycle recession $\Rightarrow$ **expected profitable investment opportunities** decreases $\Rightarrow$ supply of bonds decreases $\Rightarrow$ supply curve shifts to the left

--

<img src="../ch5/chpt5_Image/supply_left.png" width=300>



---
# Supply Curve Shifts
## (2) Expected Inflation

- **expected inflation** increases $\Rightarrow$ real interest rate decreases $\Rightarrow$ real cost of borrowing decreases $\Rightarrow$ issuing more bonds $\Rightarrow$ supply of bonds increases $\Rightarrow$ supply curve shifts to the right

--

<img src="../ch5/chpt5_Image/supply_right.png" width=300>

## (2) Expected Inflation

- **expected inflation** decreases $\Rightarrow$ supply of bonds decreases $\Rightarrow$ supply curve shifts to the left

--

<img src="../ch5/chpt5_Image/supply_left.png" width=300>




---
# Supply Curve Shifts
## (3) Government Budget Deficits

- governmentâ€™s expenditures is higher than its revenues $\Rightarrow$ **government deficits** $\Rightarrow$ U.S. Treasury issues bonds to finance government deficits $\Rightarrow$ supply of bonds increases $\Rightarrow$ supply curve shifts to the right

--

<img src="../ch5/chpt5_Image/supply_right.png" width=300>


---
# Supply Curve Shifts
## (3) Government Budget Deficits

- governmentâ€™s expenditures is less than its revenues $\Rightarrow$ **government surpluses** $\Rightarrow$ supply of bonds decreases $\Rightarrow$ supply curve shifts to the left

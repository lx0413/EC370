# Market for Reserves and Fed Funds Rate

--

- Reserves: banks's vault cash and deposits with the Fed

--

- Fed funds rate: interest rate on borrowing overnight loans of reserves from banks in the fed funds market

--

- The **target** for the federal funds rate is set at Fed Open Market Committee meetings

--

- Fed Funds Rate is determined by the demand for and supply of reserves
  - derive **demand curve for reserves**
  - derive **supply curve for reserves**
  - the reserves market equilibrium determines the level of the **federal funds rate**




---
# Demand Curve

- $RR$: required reserves, the required reserve ratio times **checkable deposits**
  
--

- in addition to depositing a certain amount of reserves at their accounts at the Fed as required reserves RR, banks have two options if they have additional reserves
  - to deposit at the Fed banks **choose** to hold as excess reserves, $ER$
  - to lend to other banks, fed funds 

--

- 2 components of quantity of reserves demanded: $R^d = ER + RR$



---
# Demand Curve

- Since the fall of 2008: the Fed has started paying **interest on reserves**, including required reserves and excess reserves

--

- **interest rate on reserves** is typically set at a fixed amount **below** the federal funds rate target (why?)

--

- $i_{ff}$: fed fund rate paid in the overnight market by lending banks 
  
- $i_{or}$: rate paid by the Fed on reserves if banks deposit reserves at the Fed
  
--

- $i_{ff}-i_{or}$: opportunity cost of holding/depositing reserves at banks' accounts at the Fed
  
--
  
- Demand curve for reserves: how changes in **federal funds rate** affects **the quantity of reserves demanded by banks**


---
# $i_{ff} > i_{or}$

- opportunity cost of holding reserves is positive: $i_{ff}-i_{or} > 0$
- $i_{ff}$ $\downarrow$ $\Rightarrow$ opportunity cost of holding reserves $\downarrow$ $\Rightarrow$  $ER \uparrow$ $\Rightarrow$ $R^d \uparrow$
- demand curve slopes downward when $i_{ff} > i_{or}$

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%', fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("chpt15_Image/demand_1.png")
```




---
# $i_{ff} = i_{or}$

- opportunity cost of holding reserves: $i_{ff}-i_{or} = 0$
- no incentive to lend in the overnight market; banks can hold infinite excess reserves 
- demand curve is flat exactly at $i_{or}$

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%', fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("chpt15_Image/demand_2.png")
```




---
# Supply Curve 

2 components of quantity of reserves supplied: $R^s = NBR+BR$
- $NBR$: open market operations conducted by the Fed
- $BR$: borrowing from the Fed, discount loan
  - $i_d$ :discount rate, cost of $BR$
      
--

- borrowing from other banks in the fed funds market is a substitute for borrowing from the Fed, $BR$

--

- Since 2003, the Fed has kept the discount rate at a fixed amount **above** the fed funds rate target (why?)

--

- Supply curve for reserves: how changes in **federal funds rate** affects **the quantity of reserves supplied by the Fed**




---
# $i_{ff} < i_d$

- no banks will borrow from the Fed, and all banks will borrow in the overnight market
- $i_{ff} < i_d: BR=0, R^s = BR+NBR=NBR$ 
- supply curve will be vertical at $NBR$

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%', fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("chpt15_Image/supply_1.png")
```





---
# $i_{ff} = i_d$

- $i_{ff} = i_d$: banks have no incentive to borrow in the overnight market; banks can hold infinite excess reserves
- supply curve is flat exactly at $i_d$

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%', fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("chpt15_Image/supply_2.png")
```




---
# Reserves Market Equilibrium

- Reserves market equilibrium: $R^s=R^d$
- equilibrium federal funds rate: $i_{ff}^{\ast}$ , also called **fed fund rate target**

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%', fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("chpt15_Image/eq.png")
```




---
# Reserves Market Equilibrium

- excess supply: when $i_{ff} > i_{ff}^{\ast}$ (e.g. $i_{ff}^2$)
- $i_{ff}$ will fall until it reaches $i_{ff}^{\ast}$

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%', fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("chpt15_Image/excess_supply.png")
```





---
# Reserves Market Equilibrium

- excess demand: when $i_{ff} < i_{ff}^{\ast}$ (e.g. $i_{ff}^1$)
- $i_{ff}$ will rise until it reaches $i_{ff}^{\ast}$

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%', fig.align = "center"}

# Tools of Monetary Policy

- tools of monetary policy used by the Fed to control the money supply

  - open market operations
  
  - discount policy 
  
  - reserve requirements
  
  - interest paid on reserves

- How Changes in the Tools Affect the Federal Funds Rate Target?



---
# I. Open Market Operations

- the Fed purchases and sells U.S. Treasury securities, especially U.S. Treasury bills (the most liquid) 

- the trading desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York conduct the actual execution by a computer system called TRAPS (Trading Room Automated Processing System)



---
# I. Open Market Operations
##### (1) intersecting the downward-sloped section of the demand curve

- open market purchase: $NBR \uparrow$ $\Rightarrow$ supply curve shifts to the right $\Rightarrow$ fed funds rate $\downarrow$, and equilibrium level of reserves increases from $NBR_1$ to $NBR_2$

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '40%', fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("chpt15_Image/open_market1.png")
```





---
# I. Open Market Operations
##### (1) intersecting the downward-sloped section of the demand curve

- open market sale: $NBR \downarrow$ $\Rightarrow$ supply curve shifts to the left $\Rightarrow$ fed funds rate target $\uparrow$, and equilibrium level of reserves decreases

- **Participation #10** Exercise: graphically show the impact on fed funds rate of an open market sale, when vertical section of supply curve initial intersects demand curve at downward-sloped section




---
# I. Open Market Operations
##### (2) intersecting the flat section of the demand curve 

- open market purchase have no effect on the fed funds rate, which stays at $i_{or}$, but equilibrium level of reserves increases from $NBR1$ to $NBR2$

- the interest rate paid on reserves, $i_{or}$, sets a floor for the fed funds rate

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '40%', fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("chpt15_Image/open_market2.png")
```




---
# I. Open Market Operations
##### (2) intersecting the flat section of the demand curve 

- open market sale have no effect on the fed funds rate, which stays at $i_{or}$, but equilibrium level of reserves decreases

- **Participation #10** Exercise: graphically show the impact on fed funds rate of an open market sale, when the vertical section of supply curve initially intersects the demand curve at its flat section


---
# I. Open Market Operations - Summary

- **supply** curve shifts to **left or right**

--

- if the vertical section of the supply curve initially intersects demand curve on the downward-sloped section
  - open market **purchase** causes the fed funds rate to **fall**
  - open market **sale** causes the fed funds rate to **rise**
  
--

- if the vertical section of the supply curve initially intersects demand curve on the flat section of the demand curve
  - open market purchase or sale has no effect on the fed funds rate
  - interest rate paid on reserves sets a **floor** for the fed funds rate
  
 
 
---
# II. Discount Lending

- The discount rate differs from most interest rates because it is set by the Fed, whereas most interest rates are determined by demand and supply in financial markets

--

- discount rate is set **higher** than the federal funds rate target: 
  - the discount rate is a penalty rate, as banks pay a penalty by borrowing from the Fed rather than from other banks
  - banks borrowing from the Fed are usually desperate for funds or are in trouble 


---
# II. Discount Lending

- Why does the Fed set discount rate higher than the federal funds rate target?
  - the Fed prefers that banks borrow from each other so that banks continually monitor each other for credit risk

--

- before the financial crisis, lending by the Fed was just a few hundred million dollars 
  - increases dramatically after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008
  - peaks at $993.5 billion in December 2008


---
# II. Discount Lending

Categories of Discount Loans:

- Primary credit consists of discount loans available to healthy banks experiencing temporary liquidity problems. Use of funds is not monitored

- Secondary credit consists of discount loans to banks that are not eligible for primary credit. Use of funds is monitored

- Seasonal credit consists of discount loans to smaller banks in areas where agriculture or tourism is important



---
# II. Discount Lending

- the Fed: lender of last resort
  - A lender that provides reserves to financial institutions when no one else is willing to do so; such lending is usually done to prevent a financial crisis
  
- discount loans is important in preventing and coping with financial panics
  - The Black Monday crash
  - the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001
  - and the global financial crisis

- The Fed’s lender-of-last-resort role has thus created a moral hazard problem: too big to fail


---
# II. Discount Lending
##### (1) intersecting the vertical section of supply curve 

- initially: no discount lending, $BR=0$
- Fed $\downarrow$ discount rate $\Rightarrow$ supply curve shiftd down $\Rightarrow$ fed funds rate unchanged 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '40%', fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("chpt15_Image/discount_lending1.png")
```





---
# II. Discount Lending
##### (1) intersecting the vertical section of supply curve 

- initially: no discount lending, $BR=0$

- Fed $\uparrow$ discount rate $\Rightarrow$ supply curve shiftd up $\Rightarrow$ fed funds rate unchanged 

- **Participation #10** Exercise: graphically show the impact on fed funds rate of an increase in the discount rate, when the vertical section of the supply curve intersects the demand curve at the downward-sloped section




---
# II. Discount Lending
##### (2) intersecting the flat section of supply curve 

- initially: discount lending exists, $BR_1 > 0$, $i_{ff}^1 = {i_d}^1$ 
- Fed $\downarrow$ discount rate $\Rightarrow$ supply curve shiftd down $\Rightarrow$ the fed funds rate falls from ${i_d}^1$ to ${i_d}^2$, and $BR$ increases from $BR_1$ to $BR_2$

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '40%', fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("chpt15_Image/discount_lending2.png")
```




---
# II. Discount Lending
##### (2) intersecting the flat section of supply curve 

- initially: discount lending exists, $BR_1 > 0$, $i_{ff}^1 = {i_d}^1$ 

- Fed $\uparrow$ discount rate $\Rightarrow$ supply curve shiftd up $\Rightarrow$ the fed funds rate rises, and $BR$ falls

- **Participation #10** Exercise: graphically show the impact on fed funds rate of an increase in the discount rate, when the flat section of the supply curve intersects the demand curve at the downward-sloped section





 
---
# II. Discount Lending - Summary

- **supply** curves shifts **up or down**

--

- if the downward-sloped section of the demand curve initially intersects supply curve on the vertical section
  - no discount lending
  - changes in discount rate have no effect on the fed funds rate 
  - the Fed typically keeps discount rate above the fed funds rate target
    
--

- if the downward-sloped section of the demand curve initially intersects supply curve on the flat section 
  - some discount lending
  - lower discount rate causes the fed fund rate to fall
  - higher discount rate causes the fed fund rate to rise

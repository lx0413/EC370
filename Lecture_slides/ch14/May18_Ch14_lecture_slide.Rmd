- In previous part: the Fed can supply the banking system with **reserves** via open market operation and discount loan

--

- when the Fed supplies the banking system with $1 of additional **reserves**, **deposits** will increase by **a multiple** of one dollar
  - this is called **multiple deposit creation**
  
--

- 2 models can explain multiple deposit creation:
  - a simple model
  - a general model

# Simple Model 
- Step 1: the Fed bought the $100 million in bonds **with reserves** from the FN Bank 

--

```{r , echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
options(knitr.kable.NA = '')

dt <- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 2, nrow = 3))
colnames(dt)<-c("Assets", "Liabilities+Capital")

dt[1,] <- c("Reserves: +$100m", "Deposits")
dt[2,] <- c("Securities: -$100m", "Borrowings")
dt[3,] <- c("Loans", "Capital")

dt %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("hover", "condensed"), full_width = F, font_size = 16) %>%
  column_spec(1:2, width = "10em") %>%
  add_header_above(c("First National Bank" = 2))
``` 

- no increase in **checkable deposits**: no **additional required reserves** needed

--

- additional $100 million of reserves become **excess reserves**


---
# Simple Model 

- **Assumption 1: bank does not want to hold excess reserves because it earns little interest on them**

--

- Step 2: under Assumption I, bank put $100m of **excess reserves** into a **loan**, which can earn high interest for the bank

--

```{r , echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
options(knitr.kable.NA = '')

dt <- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 2, nrow = 3))

  add_header_above(c("First National Bank" = 2))
``` 



---
# Simple Model 

- **Assumption 2: public does not want to hold any additional currency**

--

- Step 3: under Assumption 2, borrowers of First National Bank will deposit all 100m payment at other banks (say, Bank A)

--

- 100m of **checkable deposits** and **reserves** increases at Bank A

--

```{r , echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}

  add_header_above(c("Bank A" = 2))
``` 


---
# Simple Model 
- 10% of the **additional checkable deposits** is **required** to be deposited in Bank A's vault or Bank A's account at the Fed

--

- $10m increase in **required reserves**, leaving Bank A 90m of **excess reserves**
  
--

- Step 4: under Assumption 1, Bank A turn 90m of **excess reserves** into a 90m of **loan**

--

```{r , echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}

  add_header_above(c("Bank A" = 2))
``` 



---
# Simple Model 
- Step 5: under Assumption II, borrowers of Bank A will deposit all 90m payment at other banks (say Bank B)

--

- 90m of **checkable deposits** and **reserves** increases at Bank B

--

```{r , echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}

  column_spec(1:2, width = "10em") %>%
  add_header_above(c("Bank B" = 2))
``` 



---
# Simple Model 
- 10% of the **additional checkable deposits** is **required** to be deposited in Bank B's vault or account at the Fed 

--

- 9m increase in **required reserves**, leaving Bank B $81m of **excess reserves**

--

- Step 6: under Assumption I, Bank B turn $81m of **excess reserves** to **loans** 

--

```{r , echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
options(knitr.kable.NA = '')

dt <- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 2, nrow = 3))

# Simple Model 
- Following the same reasoning, if all banks make loans for the full amount of their **excess reserves**, further increments in **checkable deposits** will continue (at Banks C, D, E, and so on)

# Simple Model 
- Note: Whether a bank chooses to use its **excess reserves** to make **loans** or to purchase **securities**, the effect on deposit expansion is the same

- Bank A buys 90m of securities $\Rightarrow$ sellers of the securities deposit 90m at Bank B $\Rightarrow$ Bank B’s **checkable deposits** increase by $90m
--->

# Simple Model Formula 

- **Assumption 1: banks hold NO excess reserves**
- **Assumption 2: Depositors hold NO currency** 

--

Denote: 
- $RR$:required reserves 
- $R$: reserves 
- $D$: checkable deposits 
- $rr$: required reserve ratio (10% in this example)

  
  
---
# Simple Model Formula
- by Assumption 1: $ER=0, R=ER+RR=RR$ 

--

- definition of RR: $RR=rr \times D$ 

--

- substitute for RR: $R=RR=rr \times D$ 

--

- rearrange: $D=\frac{1}{rr} \times R$

--

- taking changes at both sides simultaneously: $\Delta D = \frac{1}{rr} \times \Delta R$ 
  - $\Delta D$: change in D
  - $\Delta R$: change in R



---
# Simple Model Formula
$$\Delta D = \frac{1}{rr} \times \Delta R$$

- impact of change in R on change in D is: $\frac{1}{rr}$

--

- $\frac{1}{rr}$ is called **simple deposit multiplier** 
  - Since rr is normally less than 1, the simple deposit multiplier is greater than 1
  - if rr<1: $1 increase in reserves lead more than $1 increase in total deposit



---
TWO Critques about simple deposit multiplier: 
  
--

- if banks choose to keep all or some of their **excess reserves**: assumption 1 violated

--

- if some of the loans are not deposited in banks but instead are withdrawn as **currency**: assumption 2 violated

--

- if either assumption 1 or assumption 2 is violated, the **full expansion** of deposits predicted by the simple model of multiple deposit creation does not occur




---
# Factors that Determine Money Supply
## (1) nonborrowed monetary base
- The money supply is positively related to the nonborrowed monetary base, $MB_n$, holding all other factors constant 
  
  
- open market purchase, $MB_n$ $\uparrow$ $\Rightarrow$ R in the banking system $\uparrow$ $\Rightarrow$ multiple deposit creation occurs  $\Rightarrow$ D $\uparrow$ $\Rightarrow$ money supply=M1=C+D $\uparrow$


---
# Factors that Determine Money Supply
## (2) borrowed reserves 
- The money supply is positively related to the level of borrowed reserves, BR, holding all other factors constant 


- lending to banks, BR $\uparrow$ $\Rightarrow$ R in the banking system $\uparrow$ $\Rightarrow$ multiple deposit creation occurs $\Rightarrow$ D $\uparrow$ $\Rightarrow$ money supply=M1=C+D $\uparrow$

---
# Factors that Determine Money Supply
## (3) required reserve ratio
- The money supply is negatively related to the required reserve ratio rr, holding all other factors constant 


- rr on checkable deposits $\uparrow$ $\Rightarrow$  less excess reserves can be used to make loans $\Rightarrow$ multiple deposit expansion is reduced $\Rightarrow$ D $\downarrow$  $\Rightarrow$ money supply=M1=C+D $\downarrow$

---
# Factors that Determine Money Supply
## (4) excess reserves
- The money supply is negatively related to the amount of excess reserves, holding all other factors constant 


- banks's holdings of excess reserves $\uparrow$ $\Rightarrow$ less loans can be made from excess reserves $\Rightarrow$ multiple deposit expansion is reduced $\Rightarrow$ D $\downarrow$  $\Rightarrow$ money supply=M1=C+D $\downarrow$


---
# Factors that Determine Money Supply
## (5) currency holdings
- Holding excess reserves constant, the money supply is negatively related to currency holdings


- currency holding $\uparrow$ $\Rightarrow$ less checkable deposits can be made  $\Rightarrow$ multiple deposit expansion is reduced $\Rightarrow$ D $\downarrow$  $\Rightarrow$ money supply=M1=C+D $\downarrow$


---
# Factors that Determine Money Supply
- in the general model: all three players - the Fed, depositors, and banks - directly influence **money supply**

# General Model Formula
- **simple deposit multiplier $\frac{1}{rr}$**: impact of $\Delta R$ on $\Delta D$

--

- **money multiplier $m$**: impact of $\Delta MB$ on $\Delta M$

--

- To derive money multiplier $m$ from $M = m \times MB$, let's denote: 
  - m: money multiplier 
  - M: money supply 
  - MB: monetary base
  - $c=\frac{C}{D}$: currency-to-deposit ratio
  - $er=\frac{ER}{D}$: excess reserves-to-deposit ratio
  - $rr=\frac{RR}{D}$: required reserves ratio 

  
  
  
---
# General Model Formula
- $MB=R+C=RR+ER+C=rr*D+er*D+c*D$.

--

- $MB=D*(rr+er+c)$

--

- use M1 as money supply M: $M=M1=C+D=c*D+D=D*(1+c)$ 

--

- plug M and MB into $M=m*MB$: $D*(1+c)=m*D*(c+er+rr)$

--

- money multiplier: $m=\frac{1+c}{c+er+rr}$

--

- Hence, $M=\frac{1+c}{c+er+rr}*MB$, and $\Delta M= m * \Delta MB = \frac{1+c}{c+er+rr}* \Delta MB$




<!---
# General Model Formula
- Suppose: rr=0.10, C=1200 billion, D=1600 billion, ER=2500 billion

- solve for m: 
  - c=1200/1600=0.75
  - er=2500/1600=1.56
  - m=(1+0.75)/(0.1+1.56+0.75)=0.73
 
- Given that the required reserve ratio is 10% on checkable deposits, and the behavior of depositors (represented by c = 0.75), and the behavior of banks (represented by er = 1.56):

- $1 increase in the monetary base leads to a 0.73 dollars increase in the money supply
--->



---
# General Model Formula
$$m=\frac{1+c}{c+er+rr}$$

--

- holding other variables constant, $rr \uparrow$ $\Rightarrow$ $m \downarrow$

--

- holding other variables constant, $er \uparrow$ $\Rightarrow$ $m \downarrow$

--

- when $er+rr<1$: $c \uparrow$ $\Rightarrow$ $m \downarrow$
  - in normal times: $er \approx 0$ 

--

- when $er+rr>1$: $c \uparrow$ $\Rightarrow$ $m \uparrow$ 
  - during financial crisis: $er$ is large 


---
# General Model Formula
$$m=\frac{1+c}{c+er+rr}$$

- Simple deposit multiplier is a special case of money multiplier

--

- when er=0 and c=0: $m=\frac{1}{rr}$ 

--

- er=0 is Assumption 1 in the simple model 

--

- c=0 is Assumption 2 in the simple model 
  
  
  
---
# Application: the Great Recession

- There were 14 trillion dollars of residential mortgages and commercial mortgages. If default rate is 5%, then 700 billion dollars of banks' **assets** will become toxicate

--

- In Oct 2008, to unlock frozen credit markets, a bailout bill was passed so that the Treasury Department can inject $700 billion of **capital** in many banks (partial ownership)

--

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK8G5x8pxIQ

--

- Such a move would quickly strengthen banks’ **balance sheets** and hopefully persuade them to **resume lending**. In a coordinated action, the Fed reduced their benchmark interest rates by one-half percentage point

--

- Did banks actually resume lending? 


---
# Application: the Great Recession
- during 07-09 financial crisis: the Fed initiated lending programs and large-scale asset-purchase programs (**quantitative easing**) in an attempt to bolster the economy

--

- these purchases of securities had led to a fivefold increase of the Fed’s balance sheet and an over 350% increase in the **monetary base**

--

- Such a massive expansion of the monetary base could potentially lead to a large expansion of the **money supply**

--

- $M=m*MB$: **if m is constant**, then $\Delta M = m * \Delta MB$


---
# Application: the Great Recession
- However, when the **monetary base** increased by more than 350%, the **M1 money supply** only rose by only 150%: $\Delta M \neq m * \Delta MB$

--

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '70%', fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("chpt14_Image/quant_ease1.png")
```

--

- This is because the **money multiplier** fell by around 50%: m is not constant


---
# Application: the Great Recession
- during crisis, instead of turning excess reserves to loans and lend out, banks are willing to hold huge excess reserves

--

- er $\uparrow$ so that er+rr>1

--

- plus, currency ratio had a slight downward trend

--

- when e+rr>1: c $\downarrow$ $\Rightarrow$ m $\downarrow$ $\Rightarrow$ increase in M < increase in MB

--

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%', fig.align = "center"}

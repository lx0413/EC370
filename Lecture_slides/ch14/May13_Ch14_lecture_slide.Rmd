- Recall Chapter 3: Money is also called **money supply**
  - 2 measurements of money supply 
      - M1: the most liquid assets (currency, checkable deposits..)
      - M2: M1 + less liquid assets (savings deposits, time deposits..)

- This lecture: control of **monetary base**

- Next lecture: control of **money supply**

There are 3 Players in the **Money Supply Process**

- **central bank**
  - The Fedâ€™s conduct of monetary policy involves actions that affect its holdings of assets and liabilities
  
- **banks**: depository institutions
  - accept deposits from individuals and institutions and make loans
  
- **depositors**
  - individuals and institutions that hold deposits in banks

- Liabilities of the Fed is also called **Monetary Liabilities**, **Monetary Base**, **High-powered Money**

- Liabilities of the Fed consists of:
  - Currency in circulation 
  - Reserves
  
  
---
# Liabilities
## (1) Currency in Circulation

- currency: Federal Reserve notes

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '30%', fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("chpt14_Image/currency.png")
``` 

- **currency in circulation**: the amount of currency in the hands of the **nonbank public**

- currency in circulation are assets for the nonbank public but liabilities for the Fed
  


---
# Liabilities
## (2) Reserves

**Reserves** include: 
- bank deposits at the Fed: All banks have an account at the Fed in which they hold deposits
- currency held by banks (vault cash)

--

**Reserves** consists of **required reserves** and **excess reserves**
  
--

- reserves are assets for the banks but liabilities for the Fed

``` 

- Assets of the Fed consist of:
  - Securities
  - Loans to financial institutions: discount loans 


---
# Assets
## (1) Securities

- securities: Fed's holdings of T-bills/T-notes/T-bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury
  - ch 9: banks can buy municipal bonds but the Fed can't


- purchasing securities is the primary way in which the Fed provides **reserves** to the banking system
  - the Fed buys U.S. Treasury securities from banks **with reserves**
  - this leads to an increase in the money supply 



---
# Assets
## (2) Loans to financial institutions

- The second way in which the Fed can provide **reserves** to the banking system is by making loans to banks and other financial institutions
  - the Fed makes loans to banks **with reserves**
  - this leads to an increase money supply 

- Loans to financial institutions are also called **discount loans**, **borrowings from the Fed**, **borrowed reserves**

- discount loans are liabilities for banks but assets for the Fed
  


---
- interest rates on the Fed's monetary liabilities: 
  - 0% paid by the Fed for currency in circulation
  - interest rates paid on by the Fed reserves are very low 
      - banks' deposits at the Fed earn very low interest rates for banks 

- interest rate on the Fed's assets
  - interest rates on U.S. Treasury securities are relatively high 
  - interest rates on discount loans are relatively high too (**discount rate**)
  
- The Fed's assets earn income, and liabilities cost practically nothing



---
# Control of Monetary Base

- Monetary Base $MB$ consists of:
  - currency in circulation, $C$
  - reserves, $R$ 
  
- $MB = C + R$

- The Fed control the **monetary base** through:
  - (primary) **open market operations**: purchases or sales of securities in the open market
  - **discount loans** to banks


---
# Control of Monetary Base

- open market purchase: a purchase of bonds by the Fed 
  - **reserves** go from Fed to banking system 
  
- open market sale: a sale of bonds by the Fed 
  - **reserves** go from banking system to Fed 

- Discount loans are made to banking system: 
  - **reserves** go from Fed to banking system 
  
- Discount loans are paid off: 
  - **reserves** go from banking system to Fed

# Participation 9 

Let's continue with Participation #9

_Instruction: To complete this balance sheets, show the **changes** of values for each item. For example, if you think the value of an item decreased by $10, write down -$10. If you think the value of an item increases by $10, write down +$10. If you think the value of an item isn't changed, leave it blank_

# Participation: Open Market Purchase

Q3 (1): Suppose the Fed purchases $100 million of bonds from banking system, update the balance sheet.

``` 

- the Fed pays for the bonds with reserves: causes reserves (R) to increase by an equal amount
- monetary base equals currency plus reserves (MB=C+R): increases the monetary base by an equal amount

# Participation: Open Market Sale

``` 

- Open market sale causes reserves to decrease by an equal amount, and decreases the monetary base by an equal amount

# Participation: Loans to Banking System

- Q3 (3): Suppose the Fed makes a $100 million loan to the banking system, update the balance sheet.

``` 

- because the Fed lends out with reserves: reserves increased by the equal amount
- because the monetary base equals currency plus reserves (MB=C+R): monetary base increased by the equal amount

# Participation: Loans Paid Off

``` 

- banking system paying off the $100 million loan to the Fed causes reserves decreases by the equal amount, and monetary base decreases by the equal amount



---
# Shifts from Deposits into Currency

- Now, the Fed does not conduct open market operations

- Instead, suppose there is a shift from deposits to currency

- during the Christmas season, the public wants to hold more currency to buy gifts and so withdraws $100 million in cash

- T-account of the nonbank public: 

```{r , echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
library(kableExtra)
options(knitr.kable.NA = '')

dt <- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 2, nrow = 2))

# Shifts from Deposits into Currency

- The banking system loses 100 million of deposits and hence 100 million of reserves

```{r , echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}

dt <- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 2, nrow = 3))

  column_spec(1:2, width = "10em") %>%
  add_header_above(c("Banking System" = 2), bold=TRUE, align = "c")
```


---
# Shifts from Deposits into Currency

- 100 million of additional currency is circulating in the hands of the public, while reserves in the banking system have fallen by 100 million

```{r , echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
library(kableExtra)
options(knitr.kable.NA = '')

dt <- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 2, nrow = 2))

colnames(dt)<-c("Assets", "Liabilities")

  column_spec(1:2, width = "10em") %>%
  add_header_above(c("Federal Reserve System" = 2), bold=TRUE, align = "c")
``` 

- Net Result: reserves are affected, but monetary base is unaffected by the publicâ€™s increased desire for cash



---
# Summary: control of monetary base

Two ways for the Fed to determine **monetary base**: open market operations and lending to financial institutions

- amount of **open market purchases or sales** is completely controlled by the Fed
  - The Fed places purchase or sale orders in U.S. Treasury bond markets
  - U.S. Treasury bond are liquid and welcomed, so banks always take the orders 
  
- amount of **lending to financial institutions** cannot be unilaterally determined and perfectly predicted by the Fed
  - The Fed sets the discount rate, then banks make decisions about whether to borrow
  - the Fed cannot force banks to borrow 
  
  


---
Hence, split the monetary base MB into 2 components:  

- **nonborrowed monetary base**, $MB_n$
  - from open market operations
  
- borrowed reserves, $BR$
  - from lending to financial institutions
  
- $BR+ {MB}_n=MB$

- ${MB}_n=MB-BR$
